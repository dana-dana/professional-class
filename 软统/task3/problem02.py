# A 95% confidence interval for a population mean, u, is given as (18.985, 21.015). This confidence interval is based on a simple random
# samples of 36 observations. Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation. Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are
# satisfied. Use the t-distribution in any calculations.
