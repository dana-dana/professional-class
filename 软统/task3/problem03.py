#    'The daily high temperature reading on January 1 was collected in 1968 and 2008 ' \

#    'Then the difference between the two readings (temperature in 2008 - temperature in 1968) ' \
#    'was calculated for each of the 51 values was 1.1 degree with a standard deviation of 4.9 degrees. ' \
#    'We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence of temperature warming in the continental US.
